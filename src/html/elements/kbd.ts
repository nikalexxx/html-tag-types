 * The `<kbd>` HTML element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.
